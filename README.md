# Timeline: Weekly Meeting Goals  

**Q2:** What is your goals that your group want to achieve in each weekly meeting?  
**Answer** 
Week of 10/06: Meet to plan the main idea of the project. Decide which API we will use, what data structures we need, and how to connect Flask and React together. Make sure everyone knows their part.

Week of 10/13: Set up the project structure. Create the Flask backend and React frontend. Make sure both sides can run and start sending simple test data.

Week of 10/20: Work on core features. Start adding the main functions to the backend and frontend. Make sure data is being passed correctly between them.

Week of 10/27: Continue building features. Add more pages or components and connect them with the backend. Fix small bugs along the way.

Week of 11/03: Start testing and improving. Check if the app works the way we want. Begin adding styling and small details to the UI.

Week of 11/10: Work on extra features or advanced functionality. Test the app as a full group and make a list of what still needs fixing.

Week of 11/17: Focus on debugging and polishing. Make sure everything runs smoothly and fix any broken features. Prepare for final testing.

Week of 11/24: Thanksgiving week — light work. Review project progress, finish small fixes, and prepare the final report or documentation.

Week of 12/01: Finalize everything. Clean up the code, test one last time, and get ready for submission and presentation.

# Norms  

**Q4a:** How will your group handle situations when there is conflict in your group?  
**Q4b:** How will your group handle situations when a member is not contributing enough?  
**Answer** 
*Q4a: If there is a disagreement or conflict in our group, we will hold a meeting so that every group member can share their opinion on the matter. If we still can’t agree, we will take a vote and go with the majority decision. We want to keep things respectful and work together to find the best solution.*

*Q4b: If a member is not contributing enough, we will bring it up to them immediately. If the rest of the group still does not see an improvement in the team member's behavior, will have a group meeting in discord and the team member will be given a second warrning. If the problem continues, we will let the instructor know so they can help us handle it.*

## Database Design

**Q1: What database are you using for your project (SQLite, PostgreSQL, noSQL, MongoDB,...), and why do you choose it?**
**Answer**
*We are using SQLite for our project. We chose it because it’s easy to set up and works well with Flask. SQLite is also reliable for projects that have low traffic.*

**Q2: How will database be helpful to your project? How will you design your database to support your application features?**
**Answer**
*It saves our data so it doesn’t disappear when the app restarts (e.g. food banks, needed items, pledges). It will let us search and filter food banks easily. It will also keep the data consistent for everyone on the team and supports basic data analysis.*

## Third-Party API Integration

**Q3: Which third-party API(s) will you integrate into your project? What data will you pull from the API(s), and how will you use it in your application?**
**Answer**
*We plan to use the Google Maps API. It will help us display the locations of nearby food banks on a map. We will use the API to pull data such as the address, coordinates, and directions. This will make it easier for users to find food banks near them and plan where to drop off their donations.*


**Q4: Does your API key has limitations such as rate limits or downtime? How are you going to deal with that?**
**Answer**
*The Google Maps API has some limits, such as a limit on how many requests we can make per day. To account for this downtime we can limit our requests only to when they are need (e.g. when users search for nearby food banks). We will also store basic location data in our database so the app can still work even if the API is down or we reach the limit.*

## Authentication and Security

**Q5: What authentication method will you use (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT)?**

**Q6: How will you store and protect sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, tokens)?**

## Deployment

**Q7: Where will you deploy your project (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Render)? How will you manage environment variables and secrets during deployment?**

**Q8: How will you ensure your deployment is reliable and easy to update?**
