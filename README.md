# Timeline: Weekly Meeting Goals  

**Q2:** What is your goals that your group want to achieve in each weekly meeting?  
**Answer**

Week of 10/06: Meet to plan the main idea of the project. Decide which API we will use, what data structures we need, and how to connect Flask and React together. Make sure everyone knows their part.

Week of 10/13: Set up the project structure. Create the Flask backend and React frontend. Make sure both sides can run and start sending simple test data.

Week of 10/20: Work on core features. Start adding the main functions to the backend and frontend. Make sure data is being passed correctly between them.

Week of 10/27: Continue building features. Add more pages or components and connect them with the backend. Fix small bugs along the way.

Week of 11/03: Start testing and improving. Check if the app works the way we want. Begin adding styling and small details to the UI.

Week of 11/10: Work on extra features or advanced functionality. Test the app as a full group and make a list of what still needs fixing.

Week of 11/17: Focus on debugging and polishing. Make sure everything runs smoothly and fix any broken features. Prepare for final testing.

Week of 11/24: Thanksgiving week — light work. Review project progress, finish small fixes, and prepare the final report or documentation.

Week of 12/01: Finalize everything. Clean up the code, test one last time, and get ready for submission and presentation.

# Norms  

**Q4a:** How will your group handle situations when there is conflict in your group?  
**Q4b:** How will your group handle situations when a member is not contributing enough?  
**Answer** 

*Q4a: If there is a disagreement or conflict in our group, we will hold a meeting so that every group member can share their opinion on the matter. If we still can’t agree, we will take a vote and go with the majority decision. We want to keep things respectful and work together to find the best solution.*

*Q4b: If a member is not contributing enough, we will bring it up to them immediately. If the rest of the group still does not see an improvement in the team member's behavior, will have a group meeting in discord and the team member will be given a second warrning. If the problem continues, we will let the instructor know so they can help us handle it.*

# Full Stack Group Project Track

# Track 1: Tackling Generative AI Consequences
**Problem 1:** 

**Solution 1:**

# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods 

**Problem 2:**
Students often struggle to understand what scores they need on upcoming assignments or exams to reach a desired final grade.
* Syllabi vary by course and often contain complicated weightings that make manual calculations time-consuming.
* Many students lack personalized study strategies and don’t know where to focus their efforts.
* Uncertainty about grading curves and historical trends adds to the stress, leading to inefficient study plans and sometimes missed goals.

**Solution 2:** 
A Grade-Prediction and Study-Strategy Platform that empowers students to take control of their academic outcomes.
***Key Features***
* Dynamic Grade Calculator: Continuously computes the score needed on each upcoming assignment or exam to hit a target final grade.
* Personalized Course Setup: Parses syllabus PDFs to auto-detect assignment types, weights, and grading rules.
* Goal-Oriented Tracking: Lets students set grade goals and track progress visually.
* AI-Powered Insights:
    * Narrows down the range of plausible score combinations by considering historical trends, assignment difficulty, and typical curves.
    * Suggests realistic study strategies by asking students about past study successes and their preferences (e.g., focusing more on projects vs. homework).
    * Offers predictive insights like: “If you score 82% on the final, your course grade will likely rise by 4%.”
    * Provides comparative benchmarks, e.g., “Class average so far suggests a likely curve of +2–3%.”
***UI***
* Dashboard: List of assignments, current scores, predicted needed scores.
* “Our Take” Panel: AI-generated study strategies, highlighting where to focus time for maximum impact.
By reducing guesswork, improving focus, and personalizing study planning, the platform makes academic progress more transparent and attainable 

**Problem 3:** 
Seniors often struggle to consistently manage their daily medications.
* Many rely on weekly pill boxes, which do not provide reminders or track actual intake.
* Complex regimens—different medicines at varying times and dosages—are prone to missed or double doses.
* Family members and doctors have limited visibility into whether seniors are following their prescribed schedules.
* When health metrics (e.g., TSH levels) fluctuate, it is difficult to determine whether poor medication adherence is a contributing factor.

**Solution 3:**
A Senior-Friendly Medicine Scheduling and Adherence Platform
***Key Features:***
* Intuitive Dashboard: Seniors (or caregivers) can log medicines with photos, consumption instructions, dosage details, and upload the doctor’s prescription for reference.
* Smart Reminders: Sends email/text alerts 10 minutes before medication times (default, adjustable by the user).
* Acknowledgment System: Requires seniors to confirm that they’ve taken each dose, enabling accurate adherence records.
* Dosage Tracking & Health Insights: Generates a timeline of intake history, helping caregivers and doctors correlate missed doses with health changes (e.g., spikes in TSH levels).
* Exportable Reports: Allows users to export medication history in PDF or Excel format for clinic visits or ongoing monitoring.
* Accessibility: Users will be able to easily sign up with their gmail account
* Security: 2FA authentication when logging in

# Track 3: Creative Coding and Cultural Expression

Idea:   Language learning using generative PDF translations
Story:  Learning a new language is tough, and some study material is uninteresting. Allowing users to learn using their own material 
        would help boost their learning experience. They can upload any story they want where the pages will be parsed. The user would be able to
        select any words they don't know and get the translation and meaning.
Inspo:  Linq + personal language learning experiences.

Idea:   Connect to local artists
Story:  Local artists can upload example works that they made, and people can connect to them or make requests. 
Inspo:  Job boards + the "Creative" in Creative coding made me think of art.

# Idea Finalization

**From 5 project ideas you have above, please choose one of the project that you are going with for the rest of the semester. Explain why you are going with that project**

# Extra Credit (Only do this if you are done with Idea Finalization)

## Database Design

**Q1: What database are you using for your project (SQLite, PostgreSQL, noSQL, MongoDB,...), and why do you choose it?**
**Answer**

*We are using SQLite for our project. We chose it because it’s easy to set up and works well with Flask. SQLite is also reliable for projects that have low traffic.*

**Q2: How will database be helpful to your project? How will you design your database to support your application features?**
**Answer**

*It saves our data so it doesn’t disappear when the app restarts (e.g. food banks, needed items, pledges). It will let us search and filter food banks easily. It will also keep the data consistent for everyone on the team and supports basic data analysis.*

## Third-Party API Integration

**Q3: Which third-party API(s) will you integrate into your project? What data will you pull from the API(s), and how will you use it in your application?**
**Answer**

*We plan to use the Google Maps API. It will help us display the locations of nearby food banks on a map. We will use the API to pull data such as the address, coordinates, and directions. This will make it easier for users to find food banks near them and plan where to drop off their donations.*


**Q4: Does your API key has limitations such as rate limits or downtime? How are you going to deal with that?**
**Answer**

*The Google Maps API has some limits, such as a limit on how many requests we can make per day. To account for this downtime we can limit our requests only to when they are need (e.g. when users search for nearby food banks). We will also store basic location data in our database so the app can still work even if the API is down or we reach the limit.*

## Authentication and Security

**Q5: What authentication method will you use (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT)?**

**Q6: How will you store and protect sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, tokens)?**

## Deployment

**Q7: Where will you deploy your project (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Render)? How will you manage environment variables and secrets during deployment?**

**Q8: How will you ensure your deployment is reliable and easy to update?**
