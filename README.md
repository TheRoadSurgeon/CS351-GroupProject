# Norms  

**Q4a:** How will your group handle situations when there is conflict in your group?  
**Q4b:** How will your group handle situations when a member is not contributing enough?  
**Answer** 

*Q4a: If there is a disagreement or conflict in our group, we will hold a meeting so that every group member can share their opinion on the matter. If we still can’t agree, we will take a vote and go with the majority decision. We want to keep things respectful and work together to find the best solution.*

*Q4b: If a member is not contributing enough, we will bring it up to them immediately. If the rest of the group still does not see an improvement in the team member's behavior, will have a group meeting in discord and the team member will be given a second warrning. If the problem continues, we will let the instructor know so they can help us handle it.*

# Full Stack Group Project Track  
---

# Track 1: Tackling Generative AI Consequences
**Problem 1:** Generative AI can create realistic fake news articles, images, and videos that spread misinformation online. People often struggle to verify whether content is authentic or AI-generated, and could easily be tricked online.

**Solution 1:** Build a web app that helps users fact-check content by cross-referencing claims against trusted sources. It focuses on content verification by scanning articles, pulling trusted claims, and automatically linking to reputable sources or flagging contradictions.

---

# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods 

**Problem 2:**
Students often struggle to understand what scores they need on upcoming assignments or exams to reach a desired final grade.
* Syllabi vary by course and often contain complicated weightings that make manual calculations time-consuming.
* Many students lack personalized study strategies and don’t know where to focus their efforts.
* Uncertainty about grading curves and historical trends adds to the stress, leading to inefficient study plans and sometimes missed goals.

**Solution 2:** 
A Grade-Prediction and Study-Strategy Platform that empowers students to take control of their academic outcomes.
***Key Features***
* Dynamic Grade Calculator: Continuously computes the score needed on each upcoming assignment or exam to hit a target final grade.
* Personalized Course Setup: Parses syllabus PDFs to auto-detect assignment types, weights, and grading rules.
* Goal-Oriented Tracking: Lets students set grade goals and track progress visually.
* AI-Powered Insights:
    * Narrows down the range of plausible score combinations by considering historical trends, assignment difficulty, and typical curves.
    * Suggests realistic study strategies by asking students about past study successes and their preferences (e.g., focusing more on projects vs. homework).
    * Offers predictive insights like: “If you score 82% on the final, your course grade will likely rise by 4%.”
    * Provides comparative benchmarks, e.g., “Class average so far suggests a likely curve of +2–3%.”
***UI***
* Dashboard: List of assignments, current scores, predicted needed scores.
* “Our Take” Panel: AI-generated study strategies, highlighting where to focus time for maximum impact.
By reducing guesswork, improving focus, and personalizing study planning, the platform makes academic progress more transparent and attainable 

**Problem 3:** 
Food banks often struggle to efficiently source and coordinate food donations.
* Donors may have food items to give away, but they don’t know which food banks are nearby or what items are most needed.
* Food banks have limited visibility into local donation opportunities and spend time manually coordinating pickups/drop-offs.
* Communication between donors and food banks is not very coordinated (emails, phone calls, social media posts).
* Lack of verification for food banks and donors can lead to trust issues or wasted logistics efforts.

**Solution 3:**
A Community-Driven Food Bank Donation & Coordination Platform
***Key Features:***
* Create Donation Post: Donors can post available items with details (food type, quantity, expiration date, location).
* Nearby Notifications: Automatically notifies nearby food banks when a new donation is posted.
* Donation Scheduling: Food banks can message donors to arrange pickup or drop-off times.
* Search & Filter: Food banks and donors can filter donations by food type, quantity, or proximity.
* Profile Badges: Verified organizations and donors receive visible badges to build trust.
* Map Integration: Google Maps API shows nearby food banks and donation locations for easy navigation.

# Track 3: Creative Coding and Cultural Expression

Idea:   Language learning using generative PDF translations

Story:  Learning a new language is tough, and some study material is uninteresting. Allowing users to learn using their own material 
        would help boost their learning experience. They can upload any story they want where the pages will be parsed. The user would be able to
        select any words they don't know and get the translation and meaning.

Inspo:  Linq + personal language learning experiences.

Idea:   Connect to local artists

Story:  Local artists can upload example works that they made, and people can connect to them or make requests. 

Inspo:  Job boards + the "Creative" in Creative coding made me think of art.

# Extra Credit (Only do this if you are done with Idea Finalization)

## Database Design

**Q1: What database are you using for your project (SQLite, PostgreSQL, noSQL, MongoDB,...), and why do you choose it?**
**Answer**

*We are using SQLite for our project. We chose it because it’s easy to set up and works well with Flask. SQLite is also reliable for projects that have low traffic.*

**Q2: How will database be helpful to your project? How will you design your database to support your application features?**
**Answer**

*It saves our data so it doesn’t disappear when the app restarts (e.g. food banks, needed items, pledges). It will let us search and filter food banks easily. It will also keep the data consistent for everyone on the team and supports basic data analysis.*

## Third-Party API Integration

**Q3: Which third-party API(s) will you integrate into your project? What data will you pull from the API(s), and how will you use it in your application?**
**Answer**

*We plan to use the Google Maps API. It will help us display the locations of nearby food banks on a map. We will use the API to pull data such as the address, coordinates, and directions. This will make it easier for users to find food banks near them and plan where to drop off their donations.*


**Q4: Does your API key has limitations such as rate limits or downtime? How are you going to deal with that?**
**Answer**

*The Google Maps API has some limits, such as a limit on how many requests we can make per day. To account for this downtime we can limit our requests only to when they are need (e.g. when users search for nearby food banks). We will also store basic location data in our database so the app can still work even if the API is down or we reach the limit.*

## Authentication and Security

**Q5: What authentication method will you use (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT)?**

*We will use simple OAuth to make sign-ups and logins quick and secure. OAuth is relatively easy to setup since it shifts most of the security burden to the trusted provider. This makes the platform more user-friendly and trustworthy, especially for donors and verified food banks.*

**Q6: How will you store and protect sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, tokens)?**

*Since we are using OAuth, we will not store raw passwords at all. Instead, we will securely store only the minimal information needed, such as OAuth tokens or user IDs, in the database. Tokens will be encrypted or stored with a secure library, and all communication with the server will be over HTTPS. Access tokens will be short-lived, and refresh tokens will be handled carefully to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.*

## Deployment

**Q7: Where will you deploy your project (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Render)? How will you manage environment variables and secrets during deployment?**

*We plan to deploy the frontend on Vercel, which is optimized for React applications, and connect it to a backend (e.g., Flask API) hosted on a cloud provider. Environment variables and API keys will be stored securely in Vercel’s built-in environment variable manager. This ensures secrets remain hidden from the codebase while still being accessible during runtime.*

**Q8: How will you ensure your deployment is reliable and easy to update?**

*Deployment will follow Vercel's protocol, so every update pushed to the main branch automatically triggers a new build and deployment. This ensures that fixes and new features can be delivered quickly. We will also use version control and branches to test before pushing live to avoid any unchecked bugs.*
